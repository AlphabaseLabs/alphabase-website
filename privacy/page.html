If you wish to exclude your personal information from our Services and contributor database, submit a request via email to privacy@alphabase.co.

                <h3>Security and Data Protection</h3>
                <p>Alphabase acknowledges the importance of safeguarding information but cannot guarantee complete security. By providing information to us, you acknowledge that you do so at your own risk. To minimize risks, use a strong, unique password, maintain confidentiality, update your password periodically, use up-to-date devices, and notify us of any suspected unauthorized activity. We disclaim liability for security breaches except as required by law.</p>

                <h3>Third-Party Links and Services</h3>

                <h3>Data Retention and International Transfers</h3>
                <p>Alphabase processes non-sensitive personal data in connection with the Service, retaining it as long as it remains useful for our products. We delete personal data when it is no longer used or upon a data subject's request unless we have a valid legal reason to retain it. Suppression files are used to ensure exclusion from use if data is obtained again.</p>

                <p>Our Service and Website are hosted in the United States. By accessing the Service or Website from regions with different data protection laws, you consent to the transfer and processing of your personal information in the United States.
